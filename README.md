# Godot's Dotfiles

Every developer deserves a dotfiles repo. This is mine.

## Inspiration

- [GitHub dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
- [Awesome dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles)

## Description

The `Makefile` invokes install&setup scripts in `scripts/`, while all other folders contain configs of miscellaneous tools.

To use, just run either of the following commands:

- `make config-mac`
- `make config-arch`

## Contributing

In case it does not work properly, if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
